# Data-visualization
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. In this project, I explore Seaborn. I discuss Seaborn API overview, its functionality, setting Seaborn aesthetic parameters and colour palette. I discuss different distributions, various plot types and multi-plot grids with seaborn.
